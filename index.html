<h1>Kappa Theta Pi</h1>
<h2>professional technology fraternity</h2>
<p>
  Kappa Theta Pi ( K ϴ Π ) is a professional fraternity united by a love for technology. 
  <br>
  Kappa Theta Pi was founded in Ann Arbor, Michigan USA in 2012 by seven founders who shared a love of technology.
  <br>
  These brothers and sisters came together to grow and share their love of technology with their fellow students and community members.
  <br>
  <p class="p1">Members of this brotherhood spread their love of technology through community education events, internal tech discussions, professional development events, and by fraternizing amongst themselves.</p>
  <p class="p1">Bonded by an interdisciplinary and multicultural love of technology these initiated brothers and sisters transcend by forming a higher order where one is defined by their passion for technology and driven by the pursuit of knowledge.</p>
